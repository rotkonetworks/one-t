ONE-T is a performance report bot for the *Polkadot* and *Kusama* network with special focus on the **One** **T**housand validator programme.

## Why subscribe for ONE-T reports

To get a general overview about the state of the Polkadot or Kusama network.

To promote TVP validators and get a sense of how impactful these contribute to the network.

To know how well validators are performing compared to their peers while assigned as _Para Validators_.

To get a glimpse of which _Parachains_ are validators earning more points from.

To warn about low-performance validators and identify extremely low-performances so that operators could take action.

To give any token holder an additional tool when researching by Validators to Nominate.

## How to subscribe for ONE-T reports

ONE-T is a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) bot and therefore the only place to subscribe for ONE-T reports is to join the Matrix public rooms.

After joining,  hit `!subscribe validator_stash_address` to subscribe the _Validator Performance Report_ of your favourite validators. 

Or try `!subscribe groups` to subscribe for the next six epochs the _Val. Groups Performance Report_. 

If you are just curious about which Parachains are validators earning more points from, hit `!subscribe parachains` to subscribe for the next six epochs the _Parachains Performance Report_. 

In case you want to be aware of all commands available just write `!help`.

## Polkadot // Kusama network state and Promoting TVP validators

At every era ONE-T compiles a _Network Performance Report_ and publish the results in the respective Network  Public Room. 

To bring awareness to the results an additional callout is made to the [Polkadot Watercooler](https://matrix.to/#/%23polkadot-watercooler:web3.foundation) and [Kusama Watercooler](https://matrix.to/#/%23kusamawatercooler:web3.foundation) channels inviting users to join ONE-T Public rooms and lookout for the full report results.
